# Timer: Printed Circuit Board (PCB)

## Description
A personal project built around a PIC microcontroller that enables or disables current flow through two independent circuits. The circuit is controlled from a computer through a USB Type-B port. This project is in the process of being modified to include two current sensors as well as an Ethernet port for data and power.
